# Passive python
## a toolbox for passive sampling

This in development library aims to lower the barrier to entry for researchers and people in the environmental sector who wish to work with passive sampling.

I am PhD researcher in this field and it may take a while to completely get my head around git/github rather than random local scripts so I may be slow on certain elements in the development of this library.
